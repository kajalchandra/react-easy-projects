2️⃣ What React wants

React rendering should be:

Pure

Predictable

No browser manipulation

But scroll listeners:

Talk to window

Stay alive after render

Need cleanup

👉 That’s why React gives useEffect

1️⃣ What kind of code is this?
window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll)


This is:
❌ Not UI
❌ Not JSX
❌ Not state calculation

✅ It interacts with the browser

📌 That is called a SIDE EFFECT
